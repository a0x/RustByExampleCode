Rust by Example Code
====================

Currently I am learning rustlang via http://rustbyexample.com , and in this project I will write down all the code mentioned in that website.

If you want to run the code, just simply compile it and execute the generated binary file.

## Run the code

Running this project is very easy.

After cloning this project, you can use:

```
cargo build
```

to build the source file, and run the binary file directly.

Or, you can use:

```
cargo run
```

to compile and run it after any changes to the code source.
